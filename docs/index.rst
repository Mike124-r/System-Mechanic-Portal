Why It's Important to Sign In to System Mechanic
When you sign in to your System Mechanic account, you may do more than just use the software. It links your device to your license, lets you control your subscription, and lets the program unlock all the premium features you have access to. The software may only work in limited or trial mode if you don't sign in. Some features, such automatic updates or premium utilities, may not work.

Also, logging in keeps your settings in sync between devices, which makes it easier to utilize System Mechanic on more than one PC if your licensing enables it.
